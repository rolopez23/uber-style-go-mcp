# Spec Files

Specification files define the "why" and high-level goals for a feature.

## Structure

Each spec file should contain:

- **Why**: The motivation and problem being solved
- **High-Level Goal**: What success looks like
- **Scope**: Boundaries of the work
- **Non-Goals**: What is explicitly out of scope

## Naming

Files are named `<feature>.md` and correspond to:
- `plan/<feature>.md` (top-level plan)
- `learnings/<feature>.md` (learnings)
