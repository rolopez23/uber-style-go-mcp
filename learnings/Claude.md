# Learnings Files

Learnings files capture insights and patterns discovered during implementation.

## Structure

Capture during and after implementation:

- **What Worked**: Successful patterns and approaches
- **What Didn't**: Failed attempts and why
- **Insights**: Non-obvious discoveries
- **Future Recommendations**: Guidance for similar work

## Human Understanding Section

Each learnings file should include recommendations for the human in the loop:

- **Code Walkthrough**: Key files and functions to review for deep understanding
- **Architecture Decisions**: Why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives
- **Reading Order**: Suggested sequence for reviewing the code
- **Concepts to Study**: Background knowledge that helps comprehension
- **Questions to Ask**: Prompts for the human to verify their understanding

## Naming

Files are named `<feature>.md` and correspond to:
- `spec/<feature>.md` (specification)
- `plan/<feature>.md` (top-level plan)
