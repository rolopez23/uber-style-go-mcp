## Restricted Directories

**Do not write to `exercises/` directories after initial creation.**

These paths are human-only:
- `learnings/go/exercises/`
- `learnings/mcp/exercises/`
- `learnings/go-testing/exercises/`

The human completes these exercises to learn. Claude may create/scaffold exercises initially but must not modify them afterward.
